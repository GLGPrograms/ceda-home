## Power supply

On the **original** PSU, wire colors are:

| color  | power |
| ------ | ----- |
| black  | GND   |
| red    | 12V   |
| yellow | 5V    |
| purple | -12V  |

On the power connector on the motherboard there is a key between position 7 and 8, to avoid inserting the plug backwards.

| #    | 8   | EMPTY | 7   | 6    | 5    | 4   | 3   | 2   | 1   |
| ---- | --- | ----- | --- | ---- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| type | NC  | -     | NC  | +12V | -12V | +5V | +5V | GND | GND |
